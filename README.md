App made for a client and published to [PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tfbrowser).  
It may not be outstanding front-end-wise, because most of the logic is in the Realm functions, which insert and delete data from the database to select the right links to then be opened through *Linking* inside the app.

# Main features in the project 

- MongoDB Realm Functions and Atlas Database;
- Google AdMob;
- State managing with Redux;
- Two languages(English and Portuguese);
- Google Sign-in from MongoDB;
- React Navigation;
